# TextAreaUnlocker
#### Description: Simple Chrome Extension demo that allows the user to edit textarea elements in the page. 
  
I decided to make it while writing a resume for [Naver Corp](https://recruit.navercorp.com), because I couldn't change the textbox size. It was inconvenient, and the resize property got reset whenever I saved the resume because the page reloaded on save - so fiddling with the chrome dev tool was only temporary until I decided to save my progress.  
  
It prompted me to get to experimenting chrome extensions again. I had thought about making some extensions before too, but I hadn't gotten around to actually starting it.  
  
Although this extension doesn't do anything really impressive in itself, it's a good start since the ability to inject & run scripts opens up a lot of possibilities.

## How to use
1. Start Chrome
2. Drag & Drop .crx file (v1 or v2, whichever one you want)
3. Done! For v1, all textareas will be resizeable on any page. For v2, textareas will be resizeable once you click the extension icon(Grey colored "T" square)
